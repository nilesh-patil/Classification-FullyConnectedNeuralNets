### Structure :

The repository contains code for fully connected neural network & also a demo.py file used to define & run the network. A decent variety of tests are implemented and can be seen in the solution.ipynb notebook(end). The network is designed to classify MNIST digit recognition dataset.

 * ./code folder:
   - contains original files with implemented classes
   - Added tests_all.py file which contains code used for creating plots & testing variations in the parameters
 * report.pdf:
   - Contains report for the network performance on different parameters
 * Solution.ipynb contains the full standalone work :
   - Fully implemented classes
   - Demo run
   - Testing code
   - variation tests
   - Report generation python code & markdown

* Solution.html is just the html version for this.
* I have added my results.pkl file, which is essentially the object where I have stored results from testing.
